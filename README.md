# RealityKit Workshop 
Feb 24, 2024 

### Prerequisites 
- Knowledge of Swift language is required
- Knowledge of SwiftUI framework is recommended 
- Xcode 15.X ([Download](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/))
- Physical device is required. Make sure you can run iOS apps on your physical device through Xcode 
- iOS 17 or later on physical devices 

### Projects 

#### Adding Virtual Objects to the Real World 

- Activity - In this activity, you will use the RealityKit framework to load a virtual sphere to the real world. Make sure to give purple color to your sphere and make it metallic. 

- [Download the final project](/projects/AddingVirtualObjects.zip) 

#### Adding Tap to the Virtual Objects

- Activity - In this activity, you are going to implement a tap gesture on the cube. When you tap on the cube it will change into a sphere.
